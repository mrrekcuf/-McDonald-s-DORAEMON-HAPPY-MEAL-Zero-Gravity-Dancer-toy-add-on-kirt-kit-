something NOT right with the McDonald's DORAEMON HAPPY MEAL Zero Gravity Dancer toy kit.
you will not be able to make it stand on its toes.
suspect this is due the strong magnet used in the pole.

the issues can be overcome by increasing the pole height.
this project create a add-on to make the pole higher so that the magnet will be weaker and thus make the Doraemon can "Stand on its toes" :p
