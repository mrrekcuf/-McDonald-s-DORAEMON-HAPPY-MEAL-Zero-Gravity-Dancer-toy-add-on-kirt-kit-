something NOT right with the McDonald's DORAEMON HAPPY MEAL Zero Gravity Dancer toy kit.


You will not be able to make it stands on its toes. This is due to the overhead magnet is too strong and it will pull the DORAEMON to the top.

To make DORAEMON able to dance again, you will need to increase the pole in a way that the magnet will be “weaker” and sufficient just to hold the Doraemon to make it “stand on its toes” 

here are the files (original FreeCad Cad File) and the STL file (3D print out) for the add-on. 
final reult: :)
